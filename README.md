Project Objective: This project is the first project of CS5610 Web Development course at Northeastern University. This is a good kickstart of my web development journey, a good exercise to equip me with knowledge on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, etc. Although the website is still at its beginning stage, I intend to continue updating it and eventually use this as my professional personal website so my friends, network, future employers and potential business partner could come and see the projects I have worked on in the past.
